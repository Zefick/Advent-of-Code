# Advent of Code

This is the collection of my solutions for programming puzzles from the annual <a href='http://adventofcode.com'>Advent of Code</a> event. It covers years from 2015 to 2023.

Providing an input for each puzzle is not the goal of this repository although it considered as the part of the problem. I just tried to provide a general solution for all possible inputs consistent with the examples and with my personal input.

The code for 2015-2018 is written in Java, for 2018-2023 - in Python 3 (both are clean installations without any additional dependencies).
